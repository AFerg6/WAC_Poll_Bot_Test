this bot was initially designed by asuki and remodeled by myself(gamerboy24_) 

to run the bot you need to make a config.py file that contains the bots token. 
All database tables will be generated on first launch or any where the tables arent present. 
I reccomed replacing the hardcoded stuff like emojis and default text channels and roles with whatever suits your server.

format:
config.py
TOKEN = 'YOUR TOKEN HERE'
